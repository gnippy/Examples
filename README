The files contained in this repository represents code snippets and example programs that demonstrate various aspects of connecting to the Gnip streams in several popular languages.  These examples are collected from various sources including our customers and our engineers and are not "officially" supported.  Rather, they should be considered a "jumping off point" to your own development.  They do not constitute a best practices so much as a quick look at connecting to the streams or modifying rules.

Please see the Readme files under each language folder for detail about each example.
